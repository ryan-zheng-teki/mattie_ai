/**
 * Step-by-step visualization functions for the Set Intersection Constraint problem
 * This file contains specific functions for each visualization step
 */

// These functions are already defined in index.js for this problem
// This file serves as documentation for the step functions

/*
Step 1: Understanding the Set
- Introduce the problem and the set Sω definition
- Draw a number line to prepare for visualization
- Explain the general properties of Sω

Step 2: Distribution of Elements
- Show how elements of Sω are distributed for a given ω
- Demonstrate how changing ω affects the distribution
- Highlight the relationship between ω and element spacing

Step 3: Intersection Constraint
- Visualize the interval (a, a + ne^(-0.5n))
- Show the intersection of Sω with this interval
- Demonstrate how different values of a, n, and ω affect the intersection size

Step 4: Finding Critical Values
- Identify critical values of ω that affect the constraint
- Show how these values determine the boundaries of valid ranges
- Explain the mathematical analysis behind these critical values

Step 5: Solution Range
- Present the final solution range for ω
- Explain why only certain ranges of ω satisfy the constraint
- Show visual representation of the valid ranges
